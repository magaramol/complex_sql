### entries Problem


### Problem Statement

You are tasked with analyzing visitor data from a facility to summarize key statistics for each visitor. Specifically, you need to extract the following information for each visitor (identified by their `name`):

1. The most frequently visited floor (in case of a tie, select any).
2. The total number of visits across all floors.
3. A list of resources accessed by each visitor during their visits.

You will use a table called `entries`, which logs each visit with the following columns:
- `name`: The name of the visitor.
- `floor`: The floor visited.
- `resources`: The resources accessed during the visit.

Your goal is to generate a report that summarizes this information for each visitor.

### Input Table: `entries`

```
+--------+-------+-----------+
| name   | floor | resources |
+--------+-------+-----------+
| Alice  | 1     | Resource_A|
| Alice  | 2     | Resource_B|
| Alice  | 1     | Resource_A|
| Bob    | 1     | Resource_C|
| Bob    | 2     | Resource_D|
| Bob    | 1     | Resource_C|
| Charlie| 3     | Resource_E|
| Charlie| 3     | Resource_F|
| Charlie| 2     | Resource_G|
| Alice  | 2     | Resource_H|
+--------+-------+-----------+
```

### Expected Output Table

```
+--------+---------------------+--------------+-----------------------------+
| name   | most_visited_floor  | total_visits | resources                   |
+--------+---------------------+--------------+-----------------------------+
| Alice  | .                   | .            | .                           |
| Bob    | .                   | .            | .                           |
| Charlie| .                   | .            | .                           |
+--------+---------------------+--------------+-----------------------------+
```

### Notes:
- The output should provide the most visited floor, total number of visits, and a concatenated list of resources for each visitor.

+--------+---------------------+--------------+-----------------------------+
```

### Task

Develop a SQL query to analyze the `person` and `friend` tables, compute the desired statistics, and format the output as specified in the "Expected Output Table." This will involve aggregating data to count the number of friends and summing their scores for each individual, filtering those with a total friend score greater than 100.













### Daily Trip Performance Report for Non-Banned Users


### Problem Statement:

You are required to generate a report summarizing the daily performance of a ride-hailing service. The service has two key entities: `Trips` and `Users`. Your task is to analyze the trips based on whether the client and driver are not banned and calculate metrics related to incomplete trips (trips that are not marked as 'completed').

#### Task:
- Write an SQL query to retrieve the following information for each day (`request_at`):
  1. **Total Trips**: The number of trips recorded on each day.
  2. **Incomplete Trips**: The number of trips where the status is not 'completed'.
  3. **Percentage of Incomplete Trips**: The ratio of incomplete trips to total trips.
  
- You will use the `Trips` table for trip details and the `Users` table to determine if the clients or drivers involved in the trips are banned.
  
#### Requirements:
1. Only include trips where both the client and the driver are not banned.
2. Join the `Users` table twiceâ€”once to check the client status and once for the driver status.
3. Calculate the percentage of incomplete trips as a proportion of total trips for each day.

### Input Tables:

**Trips Table**
```
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+--------------------+------------+
| id | client_id | driver_id | city_id |       status        | request_at |
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+--------------------+------------+
|    |           |           |         |                    |            |
|    |           |           |         |                    |            |
|    |           |           |         |                    |            |
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+--------------------+------------+
```

**Users Table**
```
+----------+--------+-------+
| users_id | banned | role  |
+----------+--------+-------+
|          |        |       |
|          |        |       |
|          |        |       |
+----------+--------+-------+
```

### Expected Output:
```
+------------+-------------+-----------------+------------------+
|  request   | total_trips | incomplete_trips | incomplete_percent|
+------------+-------------+-----------------+------------------+
|            |             |                 |                  |
|            |             |                 |                  |
|            |             |                 |                  |
